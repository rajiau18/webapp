  <p>Natural world is governed by the laws of biology, chemistry and physics. The planet has been there for billions of years. We are all protected and governed by nature.

A healthy environment provides nutrients that flow up the food chain, from plants to animals, to provide energy. The nutrients are then recycled to repeat the process.

We must understand these very basic principles of nature and try to live with nature. We should not depend too much on concrete structures and all sort of chemicals.

By preserving nature, the planet and all its inhabitants are guaranteed a constant supply of clean water and fresh air.
